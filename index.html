                <p>A greenhouse gas is a gas that absorbs and emits radiant energy within the thermal infrared range, causing the greenhouse effect. On Earth, the primary greenhouse gases within the atmosphere are water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and ozone.</p>
                <p>Greenhouse gases and the greenhouse effect are not neccessarily bad things. Without them, the temperature of the Earth's surface would be on average about -18&#176;C (0&#176;F), rather than the present average of 15&#176;C (59&#176;F). At such low temperatures, life on Earth would be vastly different if not impossible, and human society would likely have not come to exist.</p>
                <p>However, since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution in around 1750, human activities have increased the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases. This is of concern, as the current scientific consensus holds that anthropogenic (human) greenhouse gas emissions will lead to a rise in average global temperatures over the next few decades, with potentially harmful effects on ecosystems, biodiversity, and the economy.</p>
                <p>Road transport in particular is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in many countries. In the UK, as of 2018 <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/air-pollution-uk-transport-most-polluting-sector-greenhouse-gas-emissions-drop-carbon-dioxide-a8196866.html" target="_blank">the majority of man-made greenhouse gas emissions come from road transport</a>. The dashboard below visualises the latest official statistics available from UK government sources, covering road transport emissions between the years 1990 and 2016. More information on the statistics used to generate this dashboard can be found <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/final-uk-greenhouse-gas-emissions-national-statistics-1990-2016" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

            <div class="offset-md-2 col-md-8">
                <p>Emissions from road transport rose steadily between 1990 and 2007. Beginning in 2008 emissions began to dip, reaching a period low of 108,134 kilotons in 2013. Since 2013 emissions have been on the rise again, although they are some way off the record highs in 2007; for the latest period (2016) emissions are about the same level as they were in the early 90's.</p>
                <p>Cleaner and more efficient engines, rather than lower road usage, have helped keep emissions levels relatively stable, since the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/741953/road-traffic-estimates-in-great-britain-2017.pdf" target="_blank"> traffic volume on UK roads is at record highs</a>. With increasing investment in cleaner fuel types, and a <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/2298/the-uk-electric-vehicle-industry/" target="_blank">growing number of hybrid and electric vehicles on UK roads</a>, it is hoped that the emissions from UK roads will begin to decrease over the coming decades.</p>

                    <p>Cars are responsible for the bulk of emissions over the period, with petrol cars being the biggest contributor to the total emissions figure. However, although emissions from petrol cars have nearly halved since 1990, emissions from diesel cars are now 10x what they were in 1990. Diesel as a fuel source has <a href="https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/car-news/consumer-news/98747/diesel-ban-the-future-of-diesel-cars-in-the-uk-and-beyond" target="_blank">attracted much negative criticism</a> in recent years, with this criticism perhaps stemming from diesel's rapid increase in pollution. There have even been calls for a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/aug/23/ban-diesel-cars-from-cities-say-half-of-uk-drivers-in-poll" target="_blank">ban on diesel cars</a> in urban areas.</p>
